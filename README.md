# Repository Overview
- **Images**: contains all original images used in the thesis, including the evaluation of the user study
- **UnityProject**: contains the Unity Project of the application which was developed as part of this bachelor's thesis and used for the user study
- **UserStudy**: contains the structure and all written documents used for the user study, as well as the logged data of the participants (pseudonymized)

# Technical Details - Application
The application was developed with Unity Version 2021.3.3f1 using C\# and the ARFoundation Package Version 4.2.3. It is available on Android and has been extensively tested on a Google Pixel 2 5" (Android 11) and a Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 11" (Android 13).
For a detailed description of the application's features and implementation, see the bachelor's thesis chapter 3 The Application.

# Abstract - Thesis
The goal of this thesis is to examine and compare two data visualization methods for diagrams, namely a traditional 2D representation of a diagram on the screen of a mobile device on the one hand and on the other hand the placement of an image plane containing the diagram as an AR-element in a 3D immersive scene. Therefore, a prototype was developed to examine the feasibility of the two methods, both in regards to technical realization and user acceptance.

As a result of the subsequent user study, a linked 2D and 3D approach is recommended. The AR visualization provides great overall orientation and navigation, while the 2D visualization offers more precise manipulation and spatial flexibility. The main hurdle in this comparison is the fact that the 2D visualization is already well-established and ever-present in our daily lives, which influenced the opinions of many participants. With the shift in demographics and children coming in contact with AR at much earlier ages, this remains an interesting topic in need of further investigation in the future.
